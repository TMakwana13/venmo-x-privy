# PrivyPay

PrivyPay is a modern, user-friendly cryptocurrency wallet and stablecoin payment application built with Next.js, React, and integrated with blockchain technologies (Privy). It offers a seamless experience for managing digital assets, sending and receiving payments, and connecting with friends.

# Motivation

This project was initiated in response to the Global Hackathon organized by Encode and the Celestia Foundation. The theme was to create Stablecoin-Powered Payment App powered by Privy.

Build a Venmo-style app where users can send and receive payments in USDC, leveraging Privy wallets to manage stablecoins seamlessly. The app could also use Bridgeâ€™s API to allow users to easily convert fiat USD into USDC, enabling on-chain transactions without complex wallet setup or external exchanges.
